# We're moving...

We've been replaced!  Well, actually we're growing to more than just hdfs.  A new project has been created to reflect this and is now the active replacement.  Please see `hadoopcli` for all the same capabilities, plus more!

[Hadoop-Cli](https://github.com/dstreev/hadoop-cli)

## HDFS-CLI

HDFS-CLI is an interactive command line shell that makes interacting with the Hadoop Distribted Filesystem (HDFS)
simpler and more intuitive than the standard command-line tools that come with Hadoop. If you're familiar with OS X, Linux, or even Windows terminal/console-based applications, then you are likely familiar with features such as tab completion, command history, and ANSI formatting.

### Binary Package

[Pre-Built Distribution](https://github.com/dstreev/hdfs-cli/releases)

Download the release files to a temp location.  As a root user, chmod +x the 3 shell script files then run the 'setup.sh'.  This will create and install the hdfscli application to your path.

Try it out on a host with default configs:

    hdfscli

To use an alternate HADOOP_CONF_DIR:

    hdfscli --config /var/hadoop/dev-cfg

### Release Notes

#### 2.3.2-SNAPSHOT (in-progress)

##### Behavioural Changes
- Due to the complexities and requirements of connecting to an environment, I've removed the
ability to connect manually to an environment by simply using 'connect'.  This option was there from the beginning, but as more and more features are added, I'm finding myself hacking
away at recreating the settings and controls enabled through the configurations available in
`hdfs-site.xml` and `core-site.xml`.  Therefore, the options `-k for kerberos` and `-a for auto connect` are no longer available.  Unless specified via the `--config` option, the `hdfs-site.xml` and `core-site.xml` files in the default location of `/etc/hadoop/conf` will be used to establish all of the environment variables needed to connect.  You can have multiple
directories with various `hdfs|core-site.xml` files in them and use the `--config` option to
enable connectivity to alternate hadoop environments.
##### Removed Options
`-a` Auto Connect.  Use `--config` for alternate site files or nothing for the default `/etc/hadoop/conf`.
`-k` Kerberos Option

##### Enhancements
I noticed some pauses coming from inquiries into the Namenode JMX for `nnstat`.  Instead of requesting the
entire Namenode Jmx stack, now we target only the JmxBeans that we're interested in.  This will help
the observed pauses and relieve the Namenode of some unnecessary work.

#### 2.3.1-SNAPSHOT (in-progress)
    - Added new 'nnstat' function to collect Namenode JMX stats for long term analysis. 
    
See [NN Stat Feature](https://youtu.be/CZxx_BxCX4Y)

Also checkout how to auto fetch the stats via a script.  Use this technique to run cron jobs to gather the stats.

Where `-i stats` defines the initialization file.  See [Auto nnstat](https://youtu.be/gy43_Hg2RXk)
```
   hdfscli -i stats
```
    
#### 2.3.0-SNAPSHOT 
    - Added new 'lsp' function.  Consider it an 'ls' PLUS.

#### 2.2.1-SNAPSHOT 

	- External Config Support (See Below)
	    - Supports NN HA (thru hdfs and core site files)
    - Auto Config support using a default config directory.

#### 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT 

	- Setup Script to help deploy  (bin/setup.sh)
	- hdfscli shell script to launch (bin/hdfscli.sh)
	- Support for initialization Script (-i <file>)
	- Kerberos Support via default and --config option for hadoop site files.

#### 2.1.0

	- Added support for create/delete/rename Snapshot

#### 2.0.0

	- Initial Forked Release of P. Taylor Goetz.
	- Update to 2.6.0 Hadoop Libraries
	- Re-wrote Command Implementation to use FSShell as basis for issuing commands.
	- Provide Context Feedback in command window to show local and remote context.
	- Added several missing hdfs dfs commands that didn't exist earlier.

### Building

This project requires the artifacts from https://github.com/dstreev/stemshell , which is a forked enhancement that has added support for processing command line parameters and deals with quoted variables.

### Basic Usage
HDFS-CLI works much like a command-line ftp client: You first establish a connection to a remote HDFS filesystem,
then manage local/remote files and transfers.

To start HDFS-CLI, run the following command:

	java -jar hdfs-cli-full-bin.jar
		
### Command Documentation

Help for any command can be obtained by executing the `help` command:

	help pwd

Note that currently, documentation may be limited.

#### Local vs. Remote Commands
When working within a HDFS-CLI session, you manage both local (on your computer) and remote (HDFS) files. By convention, commands that apply to both local and remote filesystems are differentiated by prepending an `l`
character to the name to denote "local".

For example:

`lls` lists local files in the local current working directory.

`ls` lists remote files in the remote current working directory.

Every HDFS-CLI session keeps track of both the local and remote current working directories.

### Support for External Configurations (core-site.xml,hdfs-site.xml)

By default, hdfs-cli will use `/etc/hadoop/conf` as the default location to search for
`core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`.  If you want to use an alternate, use the `--config`
option when starting up hdfs-cli.

The `--config` option takes 1 parameter, a local directory.  This directory should contain hdfs-site.xml and core-site.xml files.  When used, you'll automatically be connected to hdfs and changed to you're hdfs home directory.

Example Connection parameters.

    # Use the hadoop files in the input directory to configure and connect to HDFS.
    hdfscli --config ../mydir

This can be used in conjunction with the 'Startup' Init option below to run a set of commands automatically after the connection is made.  The 'connect' option should NOT be used in the initialization script.

### Startup Initialization Option

Using the option '-i <filename>' when launching the CLI, it will run all the commands in the file.

The file needs to be location in the $HOME/.hdfs-cli directory.  For example:

	# If you're using the helper shell script
	hdfscli -i test
	
	# If you're using the java command
	java -jar hdfs-cli-full-bin.jar -i test
	

Will initialize the session with the command(s) in $HOME/.hdfs-cli/test. One command per line.

The contents could be any set of valid commands that you would use in the cli. For example:

	cd user/dstreev

### NN Stats

Collect Namenode stats from the available Namenode JMX url's.

3 Type of stats are current collected and written to hdfs (with -o option) or to screen (no option specified)

The 'default' delimiter for all records is '\u0001' (Cntl-A)

>> Namenode Information: (optionally written to the directory 'nn_info')
  Fields: Timestamp, HostAndPort, State, Version, Used, Free, Safemode, TotalBlocks, TotalFiles, NumberOfMissingBlocks, NumberOfMissingBlocksWithReplicationFactorOne

>> Filesystem State: (optionally written to the directory 'fs_state')
  Fields: Timestamp, HostAndPort, State, CapacityUsed, CapacityRemaining, BlocksTotal, PendingReplicationBlocks, UnderReplicatedBlocks, ScheduledReplicationBlocks, PendingDeletionBlocks, FSState, NumLiveDataNodes, NumDeadDataNodes, NumDecomLiveDataNodes, NumDecomDeadDataNodes, VolumeFailuresTotal

>> Top User Operations: (optionally written to the directory 'top_user_ops')
  Fields: Timestamp, HostAndPort, State, WindowLenMs, Operation, User, Count

### Enhanced Directory Listing (lsp)

Like 'ls', you can fetch many details about a file.  But with this, you can also add information about the file that includes:
- Block Size
- Access Time
- Ratio of File Size to Block
- Datanode information for the files blocks (Host and Block Id)

Use help to get the options:
    
    help lsp

```    
usage: stats [OPTION ...] [ARGS ...]
Options:
 -d,--maxDepth <maxDepth>      Depth of Recursion (default 5), use '-1'
                               for unlimited
 -f,--format <output-format>   Comma separated list of one or more:
                               permissions_long,replication,user,group,siz
                               e,block_size,ratio,mod,access,path,datanode
                               _info (default all of the above)
 -o,--output <output>          Output File (HDFS) (default System.out)
```

When not argument is specified, it will use the current directory.

Examples:
    
    # Using the default format, output a listing to the files in `/user/dstreev/perf` to `/tmp/test.out`
    lsp -o /tmp/test.out /user/dstreev/perf

Output with the default format of:

    permissions_long,replication,user,group,size,block_size,ratio,mod,access,path,datanode_info

With the file in HDFS, you can build a [hive table](./src/main/hive/lsp.ddl) on top of it to do some analysis.  One of the reasons I created this was to be able to review a directory used by some process and get a baring on the file construction and distribution across the cluster.  

#### Use Cases
- The ratio can be used to identify files that are below the block size (small files).
- With the Datanode information, you can determine if a dataset is hot-spotted on a cluster.  All you need is a full list of hosts to join the results with.
